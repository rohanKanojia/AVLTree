# AVLTree

In computer science, AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree.In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
This project was created to have a basic understanding of AVL trees and see basic rotations like LL, RR, RL and LR in different scenarios.
Application type     - Console/Text 
Platform             - Linux
Libraries used       - Ncurses

It works best in 48x170(in terms of characters) for most terminals as i've not adjusted it to different terminal sizes.If you don't have ncurses installed on your Linux/Unix machine contact yout distribution's repository.
